# Getting Started with Create React App

This Project is hosted on [minhdaonguyen.com](https://minhdaonguyen.com). This website is to showcase my front end skill as well as other projects that I have done in my career. It also provided my information such as experience, LinkedIn, and hobbies.  

This project is inspired by my internship at Resi. The experience has taught me how to structure the project in the most logical and optimal way ( breaking everything down to the smallest components).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command will start up the website\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
